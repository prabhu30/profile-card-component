## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In the process of building this project, I learnt how to add two background images to bring gradient background design to the website, I also learnt few interesting things about main tag, and reset styles.

### Continued development

As part of further development, making those statistics/numbers dynamic can be implemented. That way, as and when followers/likes increase for the person, they will get updated here dynamically. If this feature can be implemented, this profile card can be used directly while designing dynamic end-to-end websites.
